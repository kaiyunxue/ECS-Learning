This sample shows a rotating cube. 


# What does it show?

The primary purpose of this sample is to show you how data and functionality are set up in ECS. Data is stored in components, while functionality is written into systems.

The **HelloRotationSpeedSystem** *updates* the cube's rotation using the *data* stored in the **HelloRotationSpeedComponent**.
